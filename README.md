# Maintenance-Project
Software Engineering Project

This is a project that I did for my software engineering class. 
The goal of the program is to analyze defective modules and see 
how they affect the whole program that is using the module. Our
data structure is dictionary with module to module relationship.
We find the transactions, implement depth first search and 
breadth first search for tree traversals for various analysis
like finding all paths, explosion of the system, finding all unique
modules etc.
