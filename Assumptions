Assumptions:

i) The input is taken from a text file called input.txt

1) The name of the modules can be upto 10 characters

3) The data structure we build are dictionary based
e.g.
{'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'], 'C': ['F'], 'B': ['X', 'Y', 'Z'], 'D': ['X', 'Y', 'Z'],
 'Q': ['C', 'D'], 'Y': ['X'], 'X': ['P', 'Q1'], 'Z': ['B', 'F']}

3) Transactions do not appear as values in the dictionary. 
e.g. Notice, A is a transaction it only occurs as a keyword 

4) Unique modules for a transaction are set of all modules connected to A
e.g. A has B C D X Y Z F P Q1
Also, Number of unique modules is 9

5) Defective module is input after appearance of ** in input datasets
Paths from all transactions to the given defective module is calculated.
We accept only one defective module.
e.g. F in our case. We can change this in the input.txt file

6) Explosion for each transaction is calculated and presented in output
e.g For A

A
  B
    X
      P
      Q1
    Y
      X *
    Z
      B *
      F
  C
    F *
  D
    Z *
    Y *
    X *


8) The output is shown in standard output
